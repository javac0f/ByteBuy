## Inspiration

Tired of missing out on free shipping deals because your individual orders fall short of the minimum requirement? URHungry is here to simplify the lives of campus students! Our user-friendly website allows students to merge their orders with fellow classmates, helping them collectively meet the minimum price requirement for free shipping on popular grocery stores like Wegmans, Walmart, Target and more. No more hungry nights waiting for groceries, we got you! 

## What it does
1. Sign up with your student email to create an account.
2. Browse active orders that still haven't met minimum shipping requirements.
3. Add items you want to merge order with the original order, or create a new order ticket.
4. Once the minimum requirement is met, proceed with the order and enjoy free shipping!


## How we built it
We used Python, with Taipy to build the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Taipy and CSS integration. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the Taipy theme to work, and getting orders into the databases. 

## What we learned
Taipy and its associated 

## What's next for URHungry
If given more times, we would like to investigate the trends on grocery shopping to suggest orders for our users.

We also hope to roll a practical version out to the campus, either under RocLabs or another organization. This implementation can be carried out via the Hall Councils around campus, which are working on a similar project.
